Technologies: React On Rails

I chose to employ React, first and foremost because I love how it lets me use object oriented programming to make websites. Due to its effectiveness, modern websites can be responsive, fast, and engaging. The reason I chose Ruby is that, having several projects with Express under my belt, I wanted to try and work with a different technology. I believe familiarizing with the Rails framework will help me understand server functionalities better, and ofcourse, expand my toolset.
